      <h3>1. Turnaround Time</h3>
      <p>
        Since all our pieces are handmade to order, we need <strong>7-10 business days</strong> to craft your order with care before it is shipped.
        During high volume periods (like Valentine&apos;s or Diwali), this may extend slightly. We appreciate your patience.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Shipping Costs</h3>
      <p>
        We offer <strong>Free Shipping</strong> on all orders above ₹650.
        For orders below ₹650, standard shipping rates apply based on the weight and destination, calculated at checkout.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Delivery Partners</h3>
      <p>
        We use reliable courier partners like Delhivery, Xpressbees, and BlueDart to ensure your package reaches you safely.
        Once shipped, you will receive a tracking link via email/SMS.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Delays</h3>
      <p>
        While we strive to meet our timelines, courier delays due to weather or operational issues are out of our control.
